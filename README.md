## About
The goal of this project is to create a communication system that utilizes Unix signals for inter-process communication.
This involves implementing mechanisms to send and receive signals between processes, 
allowing them to coordinate and exchange information effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling**

To compile, go to the project path and run:

```shell
$ make
```


## üìã Testing

To test the program you just need to launch the "server" and the "client" in different shell tabs with the following:

```shell
$ ./server
```

This will show your PID to make the client work and will stay waiting to receive a message from the "client"

```shell
$ ./client "PID" "Your message string"
```

By launching it, this will show "Your message string" on the server window.

## BONUS

The bonus functionality operates similarly to the mandatory features, with the key difference being that the client confirms the receipt of messages sent by the server.

```shell
$ ./server_bonus
```

```shell
$ ./client_bonus "PID" "Your message string"
```
